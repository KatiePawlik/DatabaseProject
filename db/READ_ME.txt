To use database scripts:

0. Install sqlite https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/ (Get the one that says "A bundle of command-line tools for managing SQLite database files for win32-x86")
1. Run createTables.bat to create your database in the root folder as "PawlikLabs.db"
2. That is all for now

Notes * Running this will wipe your database everytime
